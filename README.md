This tool is a prototype for detecting plagiarism in dissertations *without* searching for similarities in other documents.

## The problem

The naive approach for detecting plagiarism is to compare a dissertations with tons of other papers. This approach is only successful if you would compare the new document with all other existing documents. But a lot of documents are not digitalized, or publically available.

The databases of papers grow, the workload of comparing is increasing exponentially.

Therefore we have to find a way of detecting plagiarism without the reference to other documents. This approach would be less costly and would be the first step before comparing with other documents. Also, this approach doesn't replace the other, but amend it.

## The idea

The idea is to find irregularities within the document in grammar, punctuation, style and formating.
